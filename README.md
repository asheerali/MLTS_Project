The growth of microbusinesses in the United States
poses a challenge for policymakers who lack access to sufficient
economic data to inform their decision-making. By conducting
annual surveys and gathering information on more than 20
million microbusinesses nationwide, GoDaddyâ€™s Venture Forward
team has attempted to close this informational gap. Although
current models based on internal and census data have the
ability to guide policy decisions, they might be enhanced by more
cutting-edge techniques and new information. By comparing
several algorithms, this paper attempts to enhance forecasts and
better educate microbusiness decision-making in order to build
more equitable and resilient economies. Communities and the
economy as a whole may be significantly impacted by the results
of this investigation.
